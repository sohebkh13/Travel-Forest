                    <h4>South Africa, the southernmost country on the African continent, renowned for its varied topography, great natural beauty, and cultural diversity, all of which have made the country a favoured destination for travelers since the legal ending of apartheid (Afrikaans: “apartness,” or racial separation) in 1994.</h4>

                    <h4>Tangled in subtropical foliage, the Blyde River Canyon is the largest green canyon on the planet, and one of the deepest natural canyons on Earth. Located along a sensational tourist drive known as the Panorama Route, the canyon is dotted with sensational hotspots – from waterfalls to unusual geology.</h4>

Located just a 45-minute drive from Cape Town, it’s one of the most picturesque wine-producing regions in the world, with undulating vineyards and spectacular mountain views from just about anywhere.</h4>

                    <h4>With humble beginnings as a small elephant sanctuary established to protect just 11 reddish-colored Addo elephants in the 1930s, Addo Elephant National Park is now one of South Africa’s largest national parks – and possibly one of the best for spotting these gentle giants. As the park has swelled and expanded over the years, it now consists of five different sections, each offering its own unique characteristics.</h4>

Every year, southern right whales come to this corner of Walker Bay to give birth to their young. While boat trips are touted daily, whale watching from the cliffs is just as phenomenal, if not better.</h4>

With average temperatures in the mid-20s from June to July, winter simply doesn’t exist here!</h4>

                    <h4>Reaching out into both South Africa and neighboring Botswana, the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (meaning ‘Great Thirst’) is a desert wilderness with terrain that’s totally unique. Amidst the salt pans, bushveld, and rust-red dunes of the Kalahari are hordes of plains game, such as wildebeest, springbok (South Africa’s national animal), and gemsbok (its original namesake) that are hunted in turn by predators like lions, cheetah, and leopards. Surrounded by nothing but barren wilderness, the game viewing here is simply astounding.</h4>

Often shortened to just ‘The Berg’ by locals, the Drakensberg means ‘Mountains of the Dragon.’ The meaning of such a dramatic name isn’t lost on you when you see the might and majesty of these mountains. Forming part of the Great Escarpment, the area is home to a mix of waterfalls and hiking trails split into the northern and southern reaches.</h4>

It may only be the second-largest city in the country, but it’s easily one of the most recognizable cities in the world. Located on the southwest tip of South Africa’s Western Cape Province, Cape Town enjoys a mild, Mediterranean climate and a spectacular natural setting. </h4>
