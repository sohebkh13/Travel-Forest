                    <h4>Malaysia boasts one of south-east Asia's most vibrant economies, the fruit of decades of industrial growth and political stability. Consisting of two regions separated by some 640 miles of the South China Sea, Malaysia is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious federation of 13 states and three federal territories.</h4>

                    <h4>You'll most likely fly into Kuala Lumpur when traveling to Malaysia, so this one's a no-brainer. But unlike some other big cities in Asia where travelers arrive and get out of town as soon as possible, Kuala Lumpur is a worthwhile destination of its own.</h4>

Taman Negara is Malaysia's oldest national park and is considered to be one of the world's oldest tropical rainforests.
