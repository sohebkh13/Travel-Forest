                    <h4>Sweden is a sparsely populated country, characterised by its long coastline, extensive forests and numerous lakes. It is one of the world's northernmost countries. In terms of surface area it is comparable to Spain, Thailand or the American state of California.</h4>

                    <h4>Stockholm's Old Town, known as Gamla Stan, is a small concentrated area where the city began in the middle of the 13th century. Much of the medieval enclave remains, although in typical Scandinavian style, it is freshly brushed and painted regularly. Its charm is in the architecture along its narrow stone-paved lanes and cobbled streets around its squares, especially the main one, Stortorget, surrounded by old merchants' houses.</h4>

It's now one of the country's premier tourist attractions and offers a unique perspective on Sweden's heartland. In addition, by connecting with lakes Vänern and Vättern and the Trollhätte Canal, it forms part of a water link all the way from Stockholm, in the northeast, to Gothenburg, in the southwest.</h4>
